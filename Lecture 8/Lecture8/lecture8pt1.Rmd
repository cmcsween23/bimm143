# K-means clustering

Let's make up somedata and try k-means

# Generate some example data for clustering
tmp <- c(rnorm(30,-3), rnorm(30,3))
x <- cbind(x=tmp, y=rev(tmp))
plot(x)


Our taasks
  use the k-means setting k to 3 and nstart=20
  
```{r}
km <- kmeans(x, centers = 2, nstart = 20)
km
```

#points in each cluster
```{r}
km$num.points
```



#cluster size
```{r}
km$size
```

#cluster assignment membership
```{r}
km$assignment
```

#cluster center
```{r}
km$center
```


# Plot x colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and
# add cluster centers as blue points
```{r}
plot(x, col = km$cluster)
points(km$centers, col = "blue", pch = 15)
```


Repeat for k=3
```{r}
km3 <- kmeans(x, centers = 3, nstart = 20)
km3
```

```{r}
km3$tot.withinss
```
